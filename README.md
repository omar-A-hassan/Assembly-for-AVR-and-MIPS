# Assembly Learning Journey

This repository showcases my exploration of assembly programming across two different architectures, combining formal coursework with self-directed study.

## AVR (ATmega32A)
Contains assembly programs developed during lectures from my Microprocessors and interfacing course focusing on the ATmega32A microcontroller. These examples demonstrate fundamental embedded programming concepts including:

- **LCD Interfacing**: 4-bit mode LCD control with "Hello World" display and real-time temperature monitoring
- **GPIO Operations**: Digital I/O bridging between ports and basic pin manipulation
- **Loop Control**: Various loop structures including nested loops and arithmetic operations
- **Memory Management**: SRAM operations with conditional initialization patterns
- **Hardware Integration**: ADC operations for sensor reading and display systems

Each program illustrates practical embedded systems concepts with proper initialization sequences, timing considerations, and hardware interfacing techniques essential for microcontroller programming.

## MIPS
Self-study collection exploring MIPS assembly architecture through exercises and solutions from the online course at [chortle.ccsu.edu](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/index.html). This folder contains:

- **Constant Construction**: Multiple approaches to building large hex values like `0xDEADBEEF`
- **Bit Manipulation**: Nibble extraction, reversal algorithms, and bitwise operations
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Division by zero behavior and mathematical calculations
- **Instruction Encoding**: Manual construction of MIPS machine code instructions
- **Logic Operations**: Boolean operations, bit positioning, and pattern manipulation

These programs demonstrate core computer architecture concepts including instruction formats, bit-level operations, and processor behavior under various conditions.
